# HR Analytics Dashboard
A Tableau dashboard analyzing employee data from the [IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset). Built as part of my 4th SQL and Tableau portfolio project, it explores attrition, performance, job satisfaction and income trends.

## Features
- **KPI Card**: Overall attrition rate (16.12%).
- **Bar Chart**: Attrition rate by department.
- **Grouped Bar Chart**: Performance ratings by department and job role.
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Job satisfaction by department and overtime status.
- **Line Chart**: Average income by job level and marital status.
- **Interactivity**: Department filter and click-based filtering for related visuals.
